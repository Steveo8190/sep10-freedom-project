Topic: mechnical engineering 

## Overview/Introduction/Context
* mechanical engineering has existed since the age of industrial revolution.
* engineering especially mechaical has been used to create machines which allow humans to do stuff for example work or daily life but a lot easier like cars or time.
* Tech in this industry will always grow and improve since every day new problems pop up in need of help and then people with ideas use those i deas to create solutions.
