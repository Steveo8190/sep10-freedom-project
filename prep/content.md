Topic: mechnical engineering 

## Overview/Introduction/Context
* mechanical engineering has existed since the age of industrial revolution.
* engineering especially mechaical has been used to create machines which allow humans to do stuff for example work or daily life but a lot easier like cars or time.
* Tech in this industry will always grow and improve since every day new problems pop up in need of help and then people with ideas use those i deas to create solutions.

## Part A: existing technology
### SOFTWARE
* Less complex
  
  * Solidworks
    * used for 3d modeling and it allows engineers to create a precise 3d model of parts or their desing allowing for precise mesurments and calculations based on a realistic model
    * Also it supports the entire product development process from the initial idea to the design and  generating production ready 2D drawings.
    * It can even run simulations to test and make sure how the design will perform under real world conditions before a physical prototype is made.
    * for credibilaty this is used for aerospace, automotive, medical devices, and consumer goods products.
      
  * Autodesk Fusion 360
    * Its used for 3D Design and Modeling as it offers multiple modeling methods  like parametric, direct, surface, mesh which allow for flexible and complex product design.
    * It even includes an integrated tools to prepare models for CNC machining also known as milling or turning and it helps manufacturing like 3D printing.
    *  Users can perform digital simulations to validate how a design will perform under real-world conditions, reducing the need for physical prototypes.
    *  Also it allows for the co-design of mechanical and electrical components which is  beneficial for creating smart products.
      
  * Tinkercad
    * Simplified 3D Modeling as it uses a constructive solid geometry method, allowing users to create complex shapes by adding and subtracting simple shapes like solids and holes.
    * 3D Printing Ready for Designs that can be easily exported in STL or OBJ formats, which are ready for 3D printing.
    * Circuits Simulation a browser-based electronic circuit simulator that supports microcontrollers like the Arduino Uno, allowing users to build and test virtual circuits before creating them in the real world.
    * Codeblocks which is for users to create 3D designs and animations using visual programming  which is a fantastic way to introduce coding concepts.
 
 * Ok complex
   
 * MATLAB
   * Numerical Analysis and Computation is optimized for matrix and array calculations, making it best for solving complex systems of linear equations, data processing, and performing numerical simulations.
   *  MATLAB can generate high-quality 2D and 3D plots and visualizations, which are essential for understanding simulation results, sensor data, and experimental outcomes.
   * System Modeling and Simulation is tightly integrated with Simulink, a block diagram environment for multidomain simulation and Model-Based Design. Engineers use Simulink to model and simulate dynamic systems like control systems, robotic mechanisms, and thermal processes.
   *  Engineers use it to develop algorithms for control systems, signal processing, and image processing, which are often deployed onto hardware.
  
 * ANSYS Workbench
   * Multiphysics Simulation is primary the ability to manage and integrate different analysis types or physics within a single project.
   * Workflow Management uses an innovative Project Schematic (a drag-and-drop system) to tie together the entire simulation process, from importing  geometry to meshing, applying loads, solving, and reviewing results.
   * Design Optimization is an integrated Design Exploration tools allow engineers to perform parametric studies, varying design parameters to systematically optimize the product for specific performance requirements.

 * COMSOL Multiphysics
   * True Multiphysics Modeling unlike software that focuses on a single domain, COMSOL allows engineers to fully use any number of physics interfaces and solve their Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) together in a single model. This is critical for accurate simulation of real-world devices.
   * Equation-Based Approach offers pre-packaged physics interfaces via its extensive module library, like the Structural Mechanics Module, a unique feature is its flexibility to allow users to input user-defined equations and expressions. This grants complete control to the engineer to model highly customized or novel phenomena.
   * Comprehensive Workflow provides a unified environment for the entire simulation process, including geometry creation/import, meshing, setting up the physics, solving, and post-processing the results.

 * Complicated
   
  * CATIA 
    *  CATIA is renowned for its high geometric accuracy and its superior capabilities in advanced surfacing, Class A surfacing, which is critical for creating smooth, complex, aesthetic, and aerodynamic shapes like car bodies, and aircraft wing.
    * Multi-Discipline Engineering provides a comprehensive set of integrated solutions that go beyond mechanical design to include electrical, fluid, and electronic systems design within the same 3D digital mock-up, facilitating true collaborative engineering.
 
  * Siemens NX
    * NX is a unified platform that  integrates design, simulation, and manufacturing. This allows engineers to transition rapidly from one stage to the product development process to the next without needing to switch between different software applications.
    * It supports robust parametric and direct modeling as well as highly sophisticated freeform surface modeling including Class A surfacing, which is essential for developing complex, aesthetic, and aerodynamic geometries.
### HARDWARE
* Shafts
  * The primary function is to transmit mechanical power from one part of a machine to another (e.g., from a motor to a gearbox or a wheel). This transmission is handled through torque.
  * Shafts provide the rigid axis necessary to support rotating elements like gears, pulleys, flywheels, and couplings.
  * A shaft is designed to withstand a combination of different stresses like torsional stress (due to the torque being transmitted) and bending stress (due to the weight of the components they support and the forces from gears or belts), also axial stress (due to thrust forces or tension).
* Linkages / Joints
  * The most common function is converting a simple input motion into a more complex or desired output motion.Linkages are often designed to guide an object or a point on a link along a specific, complex path.
  * They can be used to multiply or decrease the force or speed transmitted through the system example a lever, which is the simplest form of a linkage.
  * Linkages are essential in a vast range of machines, from complex robotic arms and engine mechanisms to simple everyday devices like scissors and windshield wipers.
* Bearings
  * Bearings replace sliding friction with rolling friction in the case of rolling-element bearings which results in a massive reduction of energy loss and heat generation.
  * Bearings maintain the precise position and alignment of a rotating shaft relative to its housing, ensuring smooth and accurate operation.
  * Bearings are indispensable components in everything from electric motors, pumps, and gearboxes to wheels on vehicles and spindles on CNC machines.
* CNC Milling Machine
  * The machine uses a rotating, multi-point cutting tool the mill to chip away material from a solid block , guided by computer programs.
  * The milling process is dictated by G-code (a programming language for CNC machines), which is generated from a CAD model using CAM (Computer-Aided Manufacturing) software like Fusion 360 or Siemens NX.
  * They can machine a wide variety of materials, including metals (aluminum, steel, titanium), plastics, and composites, with high precision and repeatability.
## Part B: Possible Future Technology

    * Mechanical parts that can repair themselves instantly  after sensing damage in any of their parts
    * It uses nanotechnology to be able to fix itself and also to reinforce the damaged part 

* Auto-changing mechanical arm
    * An arm that is capable of changing its shape, size, or form to fit the user's needs
    * It has a mic, so you just describe how you want it to be, and it will change its structure
      
* Universal tool
    * A tool that can be used to change anything, a mechanic's dream gift 
    * This tool can become a hammer, a wrench, or a screwdriver, and you just need to change a few parts, and boom, a new tool

* An AI hand and eye-coordinated hologram
    * A hologram that tracks your eyes and hands to give a good image or the idea you're coming up with
    * Similar to Tony Stark's hologram when he found a new element left by his father

* A double-acting piston 
    * A piston that had a double purpose, for example, pistons push air one way in an engine, but what if it pushed both ways instead, giving more power to an engine.
