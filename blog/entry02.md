## Content
Regarding software and hardware technologies i have found many things like solid works and CNC Milling Machine which are used to help mechanical both make proyect and plan them. For example in software there is this call solidworks which is used to help people create a 3d design of what they have in mind like an engine or a new invention and with this they can create a realistic 3d version of it and make detailed changes to it to fit this image of it.Another example but in hardware would be CNC Milling Machine which is a tool with a rotating multi-cutting tool to make presice cuts in stuff like lets saw wood of you need to make a highly spefic cut you would use a CNC Milling Machine which uses programs to make that difficult cut for you. Where did this all come from well it came from data bases, but why well because something i have learned is that the internet or google isn't always reliable so our school provides a database which we can use to find specific stuff like article where we can learn this stuff.
## Sources
For some of my software i have found them [here](https://www.upes.ac.in/blog/advanced-engineering/mechanical-engineering-software) and what make's this reliable well tgat fact that this comes from a university and at the bottom you can find all the credentials. What if you think it's still not good enough well here is another [one](https://www.asme.org/topics-resources/content/where-can-i-find-mechanical-engineering-resources?) which is an orginazation where i learned about engineers sources to find what i need.Now for hardware i did use the second one stated but i also used [this](https://www.homedepot.com/c/ab/must-have-automotive-tools-for-mechanics/9ba683603be9fa5395fab901511e89b3)one, what you saw home depo ha, i also used [this](https://www.ny-engineers.com/blog/6-crucial-tools-every-mechanical-engineer-needs#:~:text=Coordinate%20measuring%20machines%20(CMM),used%20in%20manufacturing%20industries'%20metrology.)here this is backed up by the [ifa](https://www.franchise.org/).
## EDP
the engineering design process is now more into the research the problem because common problems in the world are global issues such as climate change and clean water access in poor countries but then there are engineers problems like energy efficiency, managing complex projects, designs with high cost and performance, and ensuring safety and sustainability in proyects but i am more  leaning into more global issues and looking for a way how to help engineers find a way to cure global warming or even just create something for global warming. 
## Skills
i learned how to search for things for example relobale resources and i also have had a better time taking notes thanks to all the research i have to do bbut yeah task managing,research,note taking are new and improved skills i am learning and learned.
