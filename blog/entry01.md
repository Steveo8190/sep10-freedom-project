1.I have decide on Engineering more specificly Mechanicl engineering since i have a passion for cars and there beutiful engines as seen in my make a thing homework where i talked about the 3 popular engines.Also since i was a kid my favorite movie was cars and iron man because his inventions where so cool to me and just the character of tony stark was cool.But if everything dosent go as planned i could always go to either chemical engineering,cooking,or architecture since they seem intresting to me.
2. A place where i have searched for this would be [Michigan Tech](https://www.mtu.edu/mechanical-aerospace/mechanical-engineering/) because here they go into detail about mechanical engineering.But hey if you dont trust michigan tech well then trust the [Goverment](https://www.me.washington.edu/about/what-is-me) because well its the goverment. 
3. the current engineering design process  is investigation as i am looking for a problem and also looking more into detail about mechanical engineering 
4.One way i am developing outside of this would be the usual which is time management since i have a lot of high level classes which left me a lot of work and homework. Another way would be communication because i feel like i dont have that much fear now when it comes to talking to new people like me partner jessica.
